 Inconsistences with upstream:

redis plugin: Report bandwidth usage as `redis_octets`, not `total_bytes`.
redis plugin: Metric `operations_per_second` not reported in favour of `total_operations`.
redis plugin: `ReportCommandStats true` by default.

 New types added:

redis_octets            rx:DERIVE:0:U, tx:DERIVE:0:U
